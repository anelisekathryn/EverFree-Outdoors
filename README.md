# Everfree Outdoors

https://github.com/anelisekathryn/P3-app

## Overview

We’re a rag-tag group of outdoor people that love to get outside, get unplugged, and enjoy the outdoors with out emails, phone calls, texts, tik toks, or whatever else the youths are doing these days. We’ve been called quite a few names in our day, but you can call us Team Daale (pronounced: dāāl). 

Our mission and purpose is to get YOU outside (and help you find the products that make it fun, and maybe even it a little easier too). Why spend another day or another weekend indoors, connected to your phone when you can get outside instead? We believe that freetime outside frees the mind and the soul, so join our fun posse and get free in the outdoors with us!
